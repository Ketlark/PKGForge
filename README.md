**PKG Forge** is a cross-platform desktop application for **merging** and **splitting** PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 `.pkg` archives, with helpers for inspection, integrity checks, and safe renaming. The UI is built with **Svelte**; the backend is **Go**. Distribution is a **single native binary** (or app bundle on macOS) via [Wails](https://wails.io/).

## Features

| Area | What you get |
|------|----------------|
| **Merge** | Recombine split parts into one `.pkg`. Auto-detects related files from a single selected part. |
| **Split** | Split a `.pkg` into chunks with configurable size and output naming schemes. |
| **Inspect** | Read PKG header metadata (content ID, title ID, region, content type, DRM, sizes). |
| **Checksum** | Compute **SHA-256** with progress and cancellation. |
| **Rename** | Suggest and apply renames based on inspected metadata (when valid). |
| **UX** | Drag-and-drop or file picker, **progress** with speed and ETA, **cancel** long operations, **activity log**, **settings** (including language). |
| **Validation** | PKG magic / header checks for PS4/PS5-style packages. |
| **i18n** | English and French (configurable in Settings). |

**Keyboard shortcuts (macOS: ⌘, Windows/Linux: Ctrl):** `⌘/Ctrl+1` … `⌘/Ctrl+5` switch between Merge, Split, Inspect, Activity, and Settings.

## Supported split filename patterns

These patterns are used for **detection** and **ordering** when merging split releases:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `*_NNN.pkgpart` | `Game_001.pkgpart` |
| `*.pkg.NNN` | `Game.pkg.001` |
| `*.pkg_N` | `Game.pkg_0` |
| `*_N.pkg` | `Game_0.pkg` |
| `*.partN.pkg` | `Game.part0.pkg` |

## Requirements

- **Go** 1.23 or newer  
- **Node.js** 18+ (for the frontend toolchain)  
- **Wails CLI** v2:  

  ```bash
  go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest
  ```

Platform-specific build dependencies (compiler, webview, etc.) follow [Wails’ installation guide](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation).

---

## Quick start

### Development (hot reload)

```bash
wails dev
```

### Production build

```bash
wails build
```

Artifacts appear under `build/bin/` (e.g. macOS `.app`, Windows `.exe`, Linux binary). The exact layout depends on your OS and Wails version.

### Tests (Go core)

```bash
go test ./core/ -v
```
